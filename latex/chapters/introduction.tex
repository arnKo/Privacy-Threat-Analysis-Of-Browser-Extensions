\section{Motivation}
	% statistics (browser usage, extension amount, extension usage)
	% real world examples of malicious extensions
\section{Goals}
	% give an overview of what threats an extension poses for its user


\section{Approach}
	% work steps / paper draft
	
	In this thesis, we first provide an overview of commonalities and differences of current browser extension models. We present the general structure of an extension and highlight the differences that exist between the architectures of different browsers. Our focal point of this thesis lies on a cross-browser extension model which is applicable to the popular browsers Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. 
	
	Next, we present the results of our analysis of the browser extension architecture to find potential threats for a user. As a proof-of-concept for our theoretical analysis, we design an implementation which creates a malicious extension based on
