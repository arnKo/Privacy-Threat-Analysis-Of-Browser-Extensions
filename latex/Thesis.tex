	\section*{Abstract}
	
	Browser extensions are widely used today to enhance the way end users interact with the Internet. However, the broad range of functionality that the browser provides to its extensions can be misused to harm the user and violate his privacy. In last year, a number of malicious extensions were discovered by security experts and researchers have already developed ways to detect them. In our work we present the results of an in-depth analysis of possible privacy threats that emerge if using an extension. We show that malicious developer can use basic functionality to launch targeted attacks against users and violate their privacy. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a system which integrates a range of different attack vectors into existing extensions, and which is applicable to the majority of modern browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.  
	
	
	
	 browser extensions and  by developing a system to integrate explicit attacks into existing extensions. Then, we show that we can integrate our malicious implementations into real-world extensions without the need to change the extensions' structure or privileges. Thereby, the user will not notice the added behavior because the extension requests the same privileges than before. Furthermore, our work is applicable to the majority of modern browsers because we focus on an extension architecture supported by Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.
